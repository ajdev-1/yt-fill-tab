## Youtube Video Fill Tab Chrome Extension
- This extension allows you to fill the whole tab space in your browser with the video content.
- It will switch to the embed/watch mode for youtube videos on click.
- Also, it will only be available while having youtube videos opened in watch or embed mode.
- In order to switch between embed and watch mode, the extension will redirect you to the watch or embed URL of that video. Currently the video progress will not be saved. So after toggling the switcher, the video will start from the beginning.

## Potential ideas
- [ ] Keep track of the current video progress and set that after redirecting. This way the user will not lose watch progress.
